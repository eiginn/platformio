Project Configuration File ``platformio.ini``
=============================================

The Project configuration file is named ``platformio.ini``. This is a
`INI-style <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>`_ file.

``platformio.ini`` has sections (each denoted by a ``[header]``) and
key / value pairs within the sections. Lines beginning with ``#`` or ``;``
are ignored and may be used to provide comments.

The sections and their allowable values are described below.

.. contents::

Section ``[platformio]``
------------------------

A ``platformio`` section is used for overriding default configuration options

.. note::
    Relative path is allowed for directory option:

    * ``~`` will be expanded to user's home directory
    * ``../`` or ``..\`` go up to one folder

Options
~~~~~~~

.. _projectconf_pio_home_dir:

``home_dir``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Is used to store platform toolchains, frameworks, external libraries,
service data and etc.

A default value is User's home directory:

* Unix ``~/.platformio``
* Windows ``%HOMEPATH%\.platformio``

This option can be overridden by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_HOME_DIR`.

.. _projectconf_pio_lib_dir:

``lib_dir``
^^^^^^^^^^^

This directory is used to store external libraries downloaded by
:ref:`librarymanager`.

A default value is ``%home_dir%/lib``.

This option can be overridden by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_LIB_DIR`.

.. note::
    You can put here your own/private libraries. The source code of each
    library should be placed in separate directory. For example,
    ``%lib_dir%/private_lib/[here are source files]``.

.. _projectconf_pio_src_dir:

``src_dir``
^^^^^^^^^^^

A path to project's source directory. PlatformIO uses it for :ref:`cmd_run`
command.

A default value is ``src`` which means that folder is located in the root of
project.

This option can be overridden by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_SRC_DIR`.

.. note::
    This option is useful for people who migrate from Arduino/Energia IDEs where
    source directory should have the same name like the main source file.
    See `example <https://github.com/platformio/platformio/tree/develop/examples/atmelavr-and-arduino/arduino-own-src_dir>`__ project with own source directory.

.. _projectconf_pio_envs_dir:

``envs_dir``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*PlatformIO Builder* within :ref:`cmd_run` command uses this folder for project
environments to store compiled object files, static libraries, firmwares and
other cached information. It allows PlatformIO to build source code extremely
fast!

*You can delete this folder without any risk!* If you modify :ref:`projectconf`,
then PlatformIO will remove this folder automatically. It will be created on the
next build operation.

A default value is ``.pioenvs`` which means that folder is located in the root of
project.

This option can be overridden by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_ENVS_DIR`.

.. note::
    If you have any problems with building your Project environmets which
    are defined in :ref:`projectconf`, then **TRY TO DELETE** this folder. In
    this situation you will remove all cached files without any risk.

.. _projectconf_pio_data_dir:

``data_dir``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data directory to store contents and :ref:`platform_espressif_uploadfs`.

A default value is ``data`` which means that folder is located in the root of
project.

This option can be overridden by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_DATA_DIR`.

----------

Section ``[env:NAME]``
----------------------

A section with ``env:`` prefix is used to define virtual environment with
specific options that will be processed with :ref:`cmd_run` command. You can
define unlimited numbers of environments.

Each environment must have unique ``NAME``. The valid chars for ``NAME`` are

* letters ``a-z``
* numbers ``0-9``
* special char ``_`` (underscore)

For example, ``[env:hello_world]``.

General options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _projectconf_env_platform:

``platform``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`Platform <platforms>` type.


.. _projectconf_env_framework:

``framework``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`Framework <frameworks>` type.

The multiple frameworks are allowed, split them with comma ``,`` separator.

.. _projectconf_env_board:

``board``
^^^^^^^^^

*PlatformIO* has pre-configured settings for the most popular boards. You don't
need to specify ``board_mcu``, ``board_f_cpu``, ``upload_protocol`` or
``upload_speed`` options. Just define a ``board`` type and *PlatformIO* will
pre-fill options described above with appropriate values.

You can find the ``board`` type in *Boards* section of each :ref:`platforms` or
using `PlatformIO Embedded Boards Explorer <http://platformio.org/#!/boards>`_.


Board options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``board_mcu``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``board_mcu`` is a microcontroller(MCU) type that is used by compiler to
recognize MCU architecture. The correct type of ``board_mcu`` depends on
platform library. For example, the list of ``board_mcu`` for "megaAVR Devices"
is described `here <http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/>`_.

The full list of ``board_mcu`` for the popular embedded platforms you can find
in *Boards* section of :ref:`platforms`. See "Microcontroller" column.

.. _projectconf_board_f_cpu:

``board_f_cpu``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An option ``board_f_cpu`` is used to define MCU frequency (Hertz, Clock). A
format of this option is ``C-like long integer`` value with ``L`` suffix. The
1 Hertz is equal to ``1L``, then 16 Mhz (Mega Hertz) is equal to ``16000000L``.

The full list of ``board_f_cpu`` for the popular embedded platforms you can
find in *Boards* section of :ref:`platforms`. See "Frequency" column. You can
overclock a board by specifying a ``board_f_cpu`` value other than the default.

.. _projectconf_board_f_flash:

``board_f_flash``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An option ``board_f_flash`` is used to define FLASH chip frequency (Hertz, Clock). A
format of this option is ``C-like long integer`` value with ``L`` suffix. The
1 Hertz is equal to ``1L``, then 40 Mhz (Mega Hertz) is equal to ``40000000L``.

This option isn't available for the all development platforms. The only
:ref:`platform_espressif` supports it.

.. _projectconf_board_flash_mode:

``board_flash_mode``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Flash chip interface mode. This option isn't available for the all development
platforms. The only :ref:`platform_espressif` supports it.

Building options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _projectconf_build_flags:

``build_flags``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These flags/options control preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking
processes:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows:  1

    * - Format
      - Scope
      - Description
    * - ``-D name``
      - CPPDEFINES
      - Predefine *name* as a macro, with definition 1.
    * - ``-D name=definition``
      - CPPDEFINES
      - The contents of *definition* are tokenized and processed as if they
        appeared during translation phase three in a ``#define`` directive.
    * - ``-U name``
      - CPPDEFINES
      - Cancel any previous definition of *name*, either built in or provided
        with a ``-D`` option.
    * - ``-Wp,option``
      - CPPFLAGS
      - Bypass the compiler driver and pass *option* directly  through to the
        preprocessor

      - Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.
    * - ``-Werror``
      - CCFLAGS
      - Make all warnings into hard errors. Source code which triggers warnings will be rejected.
    * - ``-w``
      - CCFLAGS
      - Suppress all warnings, including those which GNU CPP issues by default.
    * - ``-include file``
      - CCFLAGS
      - Process *file* as if ``#include "file"`` appeared as the first line of
        the primary source file.
    * - ``-Idir``
      - CPPPATH
      - Add the directory *dir* to the list of directories to be searched
        for header files.
    * - ``-Wa,option``
      - ASFLAGS, CCFLAGS
      - Pass *option* as an option to the assembler. If *option* contains
        commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.
    * - ``-Wl,option``
      - LINKFLAGS
      - Pass *option* as an option to the linker. If *option* contains
        commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.
    * - ``-llibrary``
      - LIBS
      - Search the *library* named library when linking
    * - ``-Ldir``
      - LIBPATH
      - Add directory *dir* to the list of directories to be searched for
        ``-l``.

This option can be set by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_BUILD_FLAGS`.

Example:

.. code-block::   ini

    [env:specific_defines]
    build_flags = -Dfoo -Dbar=1

    [env:specific_inclibs]
    build_flags = -I/opt/include -L/opt/lib -lfoo

    [env:specific_ld_script]
    build_flags = -Wl,-T/path/to/ld_script.ld

  <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Directory-Options.html>`_

.. _projectconf_src_build_flags:

``src_build_flags``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An option ``src_build_flags`` has the same behaviour like ``build_flags``
but will be applied only for the project source code from
:ref:`projectconf_pio_src_dir` directory.

This option can be set by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_SRC_BUILD_FLAGS`.

.. _projectconf_src_filter:

``src_filter``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This option allows to specify which source files should be included/excluded
from build process. Filter supports 2 templates:

* ``+<PATH>`` include template
* ``-<PATH>`` exclude template

``PATH`` MAST BE related from :ref:`projectconf_pio_src_dir`. All patterns will
be applied in theirs order.
`GLOB Patterns <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>`_ are allowed.

By default, ``src_filter`` is predefined to
``+<*> -<.git/> -<svn/> -<example/> -<examples/> -<test/> -<tests/>``,
which means "includes ALL files, then
exclude ``.git`` and ``svn`` repository folders, ``example`` ... folder.

This option can be set by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_SRC_FILTER`.

.. _projectconf_extra_script:

``extra_script``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Allows to launch extra script using `SCons <http://www.scons.org>`_ software
construction tool. For more details please follow to "Construction Environments"
section of
`SCons documentation <http://www.scons.org/doc/production/HTML/scons-user.html#chap-environments>`_.

This option can be set by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_EXTRA_SCRIPT`.

Example, specify own upload command for :ref:`platform_atmelavr`:

``platformio.ini``:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:env_with_specific_extra_script]
    platform = atmelavr
    extra_script = /path/to/extra_script.py
    custom_option = hello

``extra_script.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from SCons.Script import DefaultEnvironment

    env = DefaultEnvironment()

    env.Replace(UPLOADHEXCMD='"$UPLOADER" ${ARGUMENTS.get("custom_option")} --uploader --flags')

    # uncomment line below to see environment variables
    # print env.Dump()
    # print ARGUMENTS


* see built-in examples of `PlatformIO build scripts <https://github.com/platformio/platformio/tree/develop/platformio/builder/scripts>`_.
* take a look at the multiple snippets/answers for the user questions:

  - `#462 Split C/C++ build flags <https://github.com/platformio/platformio/issues/462#issuecomment-172667342>`_
  - `#365 Extra configuration for ESP8266 uploader <https://github.com/platformio/platformio/issues/365#issuecomment-163695011>`_
  - `#351 Specific reset method for ESP8266 <https://github.com/platformio/platformio/issues/351#issuecomment-161789165>`_
  - `#247 Specific options for avrdude <https://github.com/platformio/platformio/issues/247#issuecomment-118169728>`_.

``targets``
^^^^^^^^^^^

A list with targets which will be processed by :ref:`cmd_run` command by
default. You can enter more than one target separated with "space".

The list with available targets is located in :option:`platformio run --target`.

**Tip!** You can use these targets like an option to
:option:`platformio run --target` command. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    # clean project
    platformio run -t clean

    # dump curent build environment
    platformio run --target envdump

When no targets are defined, *PlatformIO* will build only sources by default.


Uploading options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _projectconf_upload_port:

``upload_port``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This option is used by "uploader" tool when sending firmware to board via
``upload_port``. For example,

* ``/dev/ttyUSB0`` - Unix-based OS
* ``COM3`` - Windows OS
* ``192.168.0.13`` - IP address when using OTA

If ``upload_port`` isn't specified, then *PlatformIO* will try to detect it
automatically.

To print all available serial ports use :ref:`cmd_serialports` command.

This option can be set by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_UPLOAD_PORT`.

``upload_protocol``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A protocol that "uploader" tool uses to talk to the board.

.. _projectconf_upload_speed:

``upload_speed``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A connection speed (`baud rate <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baud>`_)
which "uploader" tool uses when sending firmware to board.

.. _projectconf_upload_flags:

``upload_flags``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Extra flags for uploader. Will be added to the end of uploader command. If you
need to override uploader command or base flags please use :ref:`projectconf_extra_script`.

This option can be set by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_UPLOAD_FLAGS`.

.. _projectconf_upload_resetmethod:

``upload_resetmethod``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specify reset method for "uploader" tool. This option isn't available for all
development platforms. The only :ref:`platform_espressif` supports it.

Library options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``lib_install``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specify dependent libraries which should be installed before environment
process. The only library IDs are allowed. Multiple libraries can be passed
using comma ``,`` sign.

You can obtain library IDs using :ref:`cmd_lib_search` command.

Example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:depends_on_some_libs]
    lib_install = 1,13,19

``lib_use``
^^^^^^^^^^^

Specify libraries which should be used by ``Library Dependency Finder (LDF)`` with
the highest priority.

Example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:libs_with_highest_priority]
    lib_use = OneWire_ID1,SPI

``lib_ignore``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specify libraries which should be ignored by ``Library Dependency Finder (LDF)``

Example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:ignore_some_libs]
    lib_ignore = SPI,EngduinoV3_ID123

``lib_dfcyclic``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Control cyclic (recursive) behaviour for ``Library Dependency Finder (LDF)``.
By default, this option is turned OFF (``lib_dfcyclic=False``) and means that
``LDF`` will find only libraries which are included in source files from the
project :ref:`projectconf_pio_src_dir`.

If you want to enable cyclic (recursive, nested) search, please set this option
to ``True``. Founded library will be treated like a new source files and
``LDF`` will search dependencies for it.

Example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:libs_with_enabled_ldf_cyclic]
    lib_dfcyclic = True
