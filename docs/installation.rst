* Specify the `pip install --user <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide.html#user-installs>`_
  option to install local to your user

1. Check a ``python`` version (only 2.6-2.7 is supported):

.. code-block:: bash

    python --version

*Windows Users* only:

    * `Download Python 2.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ and install it.
    * Add to PATH system variable ``;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts;`` and reopen *Command Prompt* (``cmd.exe``) application. Please read this article `How to set the path and environment variables in Windows <http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm>`_.

2. Install a ``platformio`` and related packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U platformio

If your computer does not recognize ``pip`` command, try to install it first
using `these instructions <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_.

For upgrading ``platformio`` to the latest version:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U platformio

.. code-block:: bash

    # uninstall existing version
    pip uninstall platformio

    # install the latest development version of PlatformIO
    pip install -U https://github.com/platformio/platformio/archive/develop.zip

If you want to be up-to-date with the latest ``develop`` version of PlatformIO,
then you need to re-install PlatformIO each time if you see the new commits in
`PlatformIO GitHub repository (branch: develop) <https://github.com/platformio/platformio/commits/develop>`_.
