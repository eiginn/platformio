Bash completion support will complete subcommands and parameters. To enable
Bash completion for `platformio` subcommands you need to put into your `.bashrc`:

.. code-block:: bash

    eval "$(_PLATFORMIO_COMPLETE=source platformio)"
    eval "$(_PLATFORMIO_COMPLETE=source pio)"

ZSH completion
''''''''''''''

To enable ``zsh`` completion please run these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    autoload bashcompinit && bashcompinit
    eval "$(_PLATFORMIO_COMPLETE=source platformio)"
    eval "$(_PLATFORMIO_COMPLETE=source pio)"

.. note::

    For permanent command completion you need to place commands above to
    ``~/.bashrc`` or ``~/.zshrc`` file.

Troubleshooting

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[Errno 1] Operation not permitted
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Answered in `issue #295 <https://github.com/platformio/platformio/issues/295#issuecomment-143772005>`_.

Windows AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'packages'

Answered in `issue #252 <https://github.com/platformio/platformio/issues/252#issuecomment-127072039>`_.

.. _faq_troubleshooting_pionotfoundinpath:

Program "platformio" not found in PATH
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Where is ``platformio`` binary installed? Run this command in Terminal

.. code-block:: bash

    # for Unix
    which platformio
    echo $PATH

    # for Windows OS
    where platformio
    echo %PATH%

For example, ``which platformio`` is equal to ``/usr/local/bin/platformio``,
then `PATH (wiki) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)>`_
should contain ``/usr/local/bin`` directory.

**Unix Users**: You can make "symlinks" from ``platformio`` program to the
``bin`` directory which is included in ``$PATH``. For example,
see `issue #272 <https://github.com/platformio/platformio/issues/272#issuecomment-133626112>`_.

PlatformIO: command not found || An error "pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound"
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Please upgrade *SetupTools* package:

.. code-block:: bash

    [sudo] pip uninstall setuptools
    [sudo] pip install setuptools

    # Then re-install PlatformIO
    [sudo] pip uninstall platformio
    [sudo] pip install platformio

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _faq_troubleshooting_pioblocksprompt:

PlatformIO blocks command execution using user prompt
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If you are going to run *PlatformIO* from **subprocess**, you **MUST
DISABLE** all prompts. It will allow you to avoid blocking.
There are a few options:

- using :option:`platformio --force` option before each command
- using environment variable :envvar:`PLATFORMIO_SETTING_ENABLE_PROMPTS=No <PLATFORMIO_SETTING_ENABLE_PROMPTS>`
- disable global setting ``enable_prompts`` via :ref:`cmd_settings` command
- masking under Continuous Integration system via environment variable
  :envvar:`CI=true <CI>`.
