NetBeans
========

NetBeans is a Java-based integrated development environment (IDE). It provides
out-of-the-box code analyzers and editors for working with the latest Java 8
technologies--Java SE 8, Java SE Embedded 8, and Java ME Embedded 8. The IDE
also has a range of new tools for HTML5/JavaScript, in particular for Node.js,
KnockoutJS, and AngularJS; enhancements that further improve its support for
Maven and Java EE with PrimeFaces; and improvements to PHP and C/C++ support.

Refer to the `C/C++ Application Learning Trail <https://netbeans.org/kb/trails/cnd.html>`_
for details.

Integration
-----------

Choose board ``type`` using :ref:`cmd_boards` or `Embedded Boards Explorer <http://platformio.org/#!/boards>`_
command and generate project via :option:`platformio init --ide` command:

.. code-block:: shell

    platformio init --ide netbeans --board %TYPE%

    # For example, generate project for Arduino UNO
    platformio init --ide netbeans --board uno

Then:

1. Open this project via ``Menu: File > Open Project...``
2. Add new files to ``src`` directory (``*.c, *.cpp, *.ino, etc.``) via
   right-click on ``src`` folder in the "Projects" pane
3. Build project using ``Menu: Run > Build Project``
4. Upload firmware using ``Menu: Run > Run Project``

.. warning::
    The libraries which are added, installed or used in the project
    after generating process wont be reflected in IDE. To fix it you
    need to reinitialize project using :ref:`cmd_init` (repeat it).
